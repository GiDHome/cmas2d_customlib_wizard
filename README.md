# CMas2D Customlib Wizard
An example of [GiD Smart Wizard package](https://github.com/GiDHome/gid_smart_wizard).

## Pr√©lude
This documentation focuses in the "wizard" part of the problemtype, but let's give 5 cents about the "problemtype" part of the files.

### The name
The name cmas2d_customlib_wizard comes from:
* **cmas2d**: Is the problem we are solving. The aim of the problemtype is to calculate the center of mass of a 2D figure. (Or system of coplanar figures).
* **customlib**: Just as a reminder that we are using GiD CustomLib technology to create the problemtype. Using this package we can easily create a tree-based GUI by implementing an xml file (called problemtype_name_default.spd).
* **wizard**: ok... :kissing_heart: 

### The concept
This example extends the cmas2d_customlib example. On the previous one, the user interaction was based on the tree. Now, this tree will be hidden, and the user will interact only with a wizard window. The tree will be hidden, but all the information will be stored there, so this wizard will use the same writing functions as the old one.

Our job here is to define the "windows definition file" and the controller, the tcl script where the steps and the actions are implemented.

## Files

### Problemtype files (for CustomLib based problemtypes)
The files that come from the previuos version:
 * **cmas2d_customlib_wizard_default.spd**: Defines the main tree, the data structure of the problemtype. Even we don't want the tree to be seen, it must be there.
 * **cmas2d_customlib_wizard.tcl**: The main script, where the basic GiD events are implemented.
 
### Wizard files
The files needed for the implementation of the wizard:
* **/wizard/Wizard_default.wiz**: The xml file where the step contents are defined.
* **/wizard/Wizard_Steps.tcl**: The wizard controller. All the functions related with the wizard must be implemented here.

## Initialization
In the main script, we have added in the InitGIDProject project:

```tcl
    # Load the package
    package require gid_smart_wizard
    
    # Init the wizard window
    Cmas2d::StartWizard
```
... and the Cmas2d::StartWindow function:


```tcl
proc Cmas2d::StartWizard { } {   
    variable dir
    if { [GidUtils::IsTkDisabled] } {  
        return
    }          
    smart_wizard::Init
    uplevel #0 [list source [file join $dir wizard Wizard_Steps.tcl]]
    smart_wizard::SetWizardNamespace "::Cmas2d::Wizard"
    smart_wizard::SetWizardWindowName ".gid.wizard"
    smart_wizard::SetWizardImageDirectory [file join $dir images]
    smart_wizard::LoadWizardDoc [file join $dir wizard Wizard_default.wiz]
    smart_wizard::ImportWizardData

    smart_wizard::CreateWindow
}
```
First of all, we check if GiD is using TK (as you may know, GiD can be executed in a "windowless" mode). 
Init the package, load our step controller file, called /wizard/Wizard_Steps.tcl, and set some variables. See the [Initialize](https://github.com/GiDHome/gid_smart_wizard#initialize) section of the manual.


## Data definition

Let's start talking about what data is needed in this problemtype, and how this data is organized in steps

### Step 1: Geometry definition

We need to create a random surface, so the first step is called 'Geometry'. It contains 2 frames, the right one contains an image, and the left one has the inputs and the button to create the geometry. In the prevoius problemtype, a 4 side random geometry was generated wich was fine for the example. Now, in order to explain hoy to implement a button that executes a tcl command, wich takes the value of the items of the window, we allow the user to select the number of vertex and the radius of the geometry.

```xml
<Step id="Geometry" title="Geometry definition" subtitle="Create a regular geometry with n vertex">
    <Data>
        <Frame n="Image" position="right">
          <Item n="ImageGeom" v="geometry.jpg" type="image"/>
        </Frame>
        <Frame n="Data" position="left" title="Define geometrical data">
          <Item n="NVertex" pn="Number of vertex" v="5" type="integer" xpath=""/>
          <Item n="Radius" pn="Radius" v="10" type="double" xpath=""/>
          <Item n="DrawButton" pn="Create geometry" type="button" v="Cmas2d::Wizard::CreateGeometry" xpath=""/>
        </Frame>
    </Data>
</Step>
```

The xml above generates the following step window:
